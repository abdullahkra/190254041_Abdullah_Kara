Network securty has become an ncreasngly complex and
evolvng feld n today's dgtal age. Technologcal
advancements and the process of dgtal transformaton
have led to networks becomng even more ntrcate, gvng
rse to new threats. In ths presentaton, we wll examne
three sgnfcant threats encountered n the feld of network
securty and evaluate countermeasures for each one.

###### Artfcal Intellgence (AI)

###### Supported Attacks

Artfcal ntellgence (AI) s utlzed n both defensve and
offensve methods n the feld of network securty. AI-
supported attacks can be executed n a more unpredctable
manner compared to tradtonal attack methods. For
nstance, AI-based malware can rapdly and automatcally
alter attack vectors and bypass defense systems. In addton
to ths, malcous software attacks, phshng attacks, etc.


##### Countermeasures for AI-supported

##### Attacks

```
Development of attack detecton systems usng
machne learnng and AI.
Utlzaton of automated systems for contnuous
montorng of network traffc and rapd anomaly
detecton.
Implementaton of AI-based defense systems.
Malcous Software Detecton
Artfcal ntellgence can be traned to detect
and analyze malcous software based on ts
code or behavor. Machne learnng
algorthms can dentfy patterns and
sgnatures of known malware and then apply
ths knowledge to detect and prevent future
attacks.
Phshng Detecton
AI can be utlzed to detect and prevent phshng attacks by
analyzng emal and socal meda messages. Machne learnng
algorthms can dentfy and flag suspcous messages based on
characterstcs such as the sender's doman, message content,
and user behavor. Ths can help prevent users from
nadvertently clckng on malcous lnks or provdng senstve
nformaton to attackers.
AI-supported antvrus software can provde faster
and more accurate protecton than tradtonal
antvrus software by learnng new types of
malcous software and adaptng to them.
```

Attacks va IoT Devces
Internet of Thngs (IoT) devces are
becomng ncreasngly prevalent
among connected devces n
networks. However, these devces
often have weak securty measures
and can be easy targets for
attackers. The msuse of IoT
devces can lead to network
nfltraton, data theft, and even
physcal harm.


IoT devces appear hghly vulnerable due to several reasons:
Lack of securty software on devces: Unlke regular computers,
IoT devces typcally lack securty frewalls or vrus scanners.
Less experenced devce manufacturers: Busnesses often lack
the IT securty expertse of server/computer manufacturers.
Multple devces wth the same securty mechansms: An attack
that works on one devce wll work on thousands of devces.
Inaccessblty of IoT devces: Devce owners deploy ther
machnes remotely. Often, the devce owner doesn't realze ther
devces have been compromsed untl t's too late. Once an
attacker gans control over a devce, they can operate all day
untl physcally shut down by the devce owner.


Countermeasures Aganst Attacks va
IoT Devces
Development and enforcement of
securty standards and protocols.
Strengthenng IoT devces wth securty
software and ensurng regular updates.
Implementng network segmentaton
and tghtenng access control to crtcal
systems.


Quantum Computng Securty
Vulnerabltes
Quantum computers pose a potental
threat to tradtonal encrypton
methods. Securty vulnerabltes n
quantum computng could lead to the
breakng of current encrypton
algorthms and put senstve data at
rsk. Quantum computers can solve a
code that a classcal computer would
take years to crack n a matter of
hours.


## Concluson

In ths presentaton, we addressed three sgnfcant emergng threats such
as AI-supported attacks, attacks va IoT devces, and quantum computng
securty vulnerabltes, and examned countermeasures for each.
Organzatons need to contnuously update and mprove securty measures
to effectvely protect aganst these threats. Implementng the proposed
measures wll strengthen organzatons' network securty and better prepare
them for future threats. My vew s that anyone who s unsure about ther
securty should quckly seek support from cybersecurty experts.
